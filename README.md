*DESCRIPTION*: The visual foundation of this landing page was created entirely in Figma. It features a dark color scheme with rich gradients. Deep blues and purples blend together, giving a cosmic or "galaxy" theme that suggests technology and security. This fits well with the cryptocurrency field. Figma's precise color tools helped create these gradients, ensuring a smooth transition that adds depth without being overwhelming. Subtle background speckles, likely made using Figma's fill options and effects, add texture and prevent a flat look. The "COINFLIP" logo appears in clear white sans-serif letters, prominently placed at the top left. This showcases Figma's strong typography controls for consistent branding. The bright blues, purples, and oranges used for interactive elements and floating assets highlight Figma's skill in managing different color palettes and visual hierarchy effectively.
